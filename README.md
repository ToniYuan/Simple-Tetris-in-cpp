# Simple Tetris in c++

## Description:
This is not 100% original work from me, I used a YouTuber's video guide me to accomplish this little program to help me understand more about c++.
Here is video's link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OK8_tHeCIA&list=PLrOv9FMX8xJE8NgepZR1etrsU63fDDGxO&index=1

## Key things need to know:
Because of I'm using a MacOS computer, but the original author is using Windows to create this program, this will make some difference during coding due to different environment.

For this game, some terminal libraries are used but not graphics libraries.
I used ncurses to implemented same effect as windows version.

## Environment Requirements:
- MacOS
- C++ 11 installed
- ncurses installed

## To compile:
``` g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main -lncurses ```

## Run Program:
``` ./main ```
